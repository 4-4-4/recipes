         <p>The Krabby Patty secret formula is the recipe for the highly popular 
            Krabby Patty burger sold by the famous Bikini Bottom restaurant, the Krusty Krab. There are many variations of the Krabby 
            Patty, but all have one secret ingredient, which is yet to be identified or revealed. The secret formula was first mentioned in
             "Plankton!" and made its first physical appearance in "Imitation Krabs."
            Throughout the series, Plankton tries to steal the formula, 
            hoping to sell Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket and run Krabs out of business. Karen gives Plankton many of his plans to steal the formula, and she is able to analyze a Krabby Patty to extract the formula herself, as seen in two episodes. Plankton has temporarily taken the formula on several occasions, most notably in the 2004 and 2020 movies,
             although the formula was ultimately returned in all cases.</p>
